/**
 * S1 — Mic + turn detection (JarvisAgentApp 1.4.0).
 *
 * Turn end is decided HERE, by our own silence + completeness logic —
 * NEVER by the recognizer's onEndOfSpeech / onResults signal. The old
 * bug was exactly that: the system recognizer self-stops on a short
 * pause ("halt"), so Jarvis acted on a partial command. This class
 * only ever sees timestamps and text; it knows nothing about Android
 * recognizers, so it is unit-testable without a device.
 *
 * Thresholds (chosen per the S1 brief, all in milliseconds):
 * - SHORT_SILENCE_MS (1000): a pause shorter than this is just a
 *   breath / "halt" — always keep waiting, never end the turn.
 * - TURN_END_SILENCE_MS (1750, inside the 1.5–2s band): silence this
 *   long after the last partial AND a sentence that looks complete
 *   ends the turn.
 * - INCOMPLETE_EXTRA_WAIT_MS (5000): after an "incomplete" signal,
 *   the caller speaks "aur bolo, poora sun raha hoon" and waits this
 *   long for continuation. If nothing more arrives, the buffered
 *   text is emitted as a Complete turn anyway — the mic loop must
 *   never hang forever on a fragment.
 *
 * Completeness is a heuristic, not a parser, and it is deliberately
 * conservative: a false "incomplete" costs one prompt; a false
 * "complete" costs acting on half a command. The 5s fallback bounds
 * the cost of either mistake.

/**
 * Barge-in during TTS playback (S1 echo amendment).
 *
 * While Jarvis is speaking, the mic still hears — including Jarvis's
 * own voice through the speaker. A barge-in is therefore NOT "any
 * speech during TTS". It is a loud, user-initiated stop keyword at
 * the START of the transcript, with an echo guard:
 * - the transcript must START with a stop keyword ("ruk", "ruko",
 *   "bas", "chup", "stop", "ruk ja") — an interrupting user starts
 *   with the stop word; Jarvis's own speech rarely does;
 * - if the text Jarvis is currently speaking itself contains that
 *   keyword (e.g. Jarvis saying "ruk gaya"), the transcript must
 *   start with the keyword while the spoken text does NOT — otherwise
 *   Jarvis would interrupt himself on his own echo;
 * - the keyword must also be louder than the listening baseline by
 *   [LOUD_MARGIN_DB] on KNOWN RMS values; unknown RMS never passes
 *   (B-C3) — the manager freezes RMS while speaking, so playback
 *   can never inflate the compared level. This is a best-effort
 *   heuristic, not a guarantee:
 *   a quiet user on a loud speaker can still be missed, and a loud
 *   echo that starts with "ruk" can still false-trigger. The
 *   remainder after the keyword is kept, so "ruk, youtube band karo"
 *   still yields the follow-up command.
